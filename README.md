# 🪐 hitchhikersgalaxy.guide

**Don't Panic.** This is an AI-powered, entirely generative website version of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.

Every page is born when you ask for it — just like the original Guide (minus the sarcasm filter). It's not a static site. It’s not a wiki. It’s the Guide, reimagined by a mildly confused neural network with access to far too much cosmic trivia.

## What is this?

A living, breathing, constantly mutating Guide to everything in the galaxy (and several things outside it).  
Built for web. Powered by AI. Fueled by improbability.

You search — it generates.  
Want to know about Vogon poetry? It has *opinions*.  
Curious about towels? It's got you covered.

## Features

- 🌌 Fully generative content — no static pages, ever  
- 🤖 Uses AI to emulate the tone and chaos of the original Guide  
- 🧠 React + Next.js frontend with API-powered entries  
- 🔍 Search to create entries — or just type something weird  
- 🫠 Occasionally coherent. Frequently absurd.

## Built With

- Next.js  
- AI (GPT-style models)  
- Curiosity and possibly a little tea  

## 🚀 Live Site

👉 [hitchhikersgalaxy.guide](https://hitchhikersgalaxy.guide)

Try searching for:
- *Vogon Poetry*
- *42*
- *Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster*
- *The best way to survive a Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal*

Each search becomes a new, permanent Guide entry. Reality is handcrafted on demand.
